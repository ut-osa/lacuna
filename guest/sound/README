A simple playback tool that does:
1.
Generate 4 8-byte random tokens. Print out the ascii codes of these tokens,
so it is not the raw data. like \x73\x62\x75\x78\x70\x62\x79\x75
2.
Write the tokens to alsa, repeatedly for 5 seconds. Then ERASE the buffers in
the program. (The tokens only contains letters, for easily using grep).

After running this program, you can dump the physical memory, and grep like:
grep -a $(printf "\x73\x62\x75\x78\x70\x62\x79\x75") dumpfile > scanoutput

As an example, the file "scanoutput_no_lacuna" contains part of the grep output,
for a normal execution without Lacuna.

Note:
Before run this, do the following steps for both host and guest:
 - Open the Ubuntu sound setting pannel, and choose 'hardware' to be 'analog stereo output'.
 - Set 'output volume' to exactly '100%', to avoid re-scaling.
 - Make sure that no other applications are playing any sound, to avoid mixing.
