# Lacuna

Lacuna is a project whose goal is to allow users to run programs in a
way that they do not leave behind evidence of actions taken within
them.  See our OSDI 2012
[paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi12/osdi12-final-100.pdf)
for more details.

Lacuna is **research grade software**.  It almost certainly has bugs
and vulnerabilities, and could mess up your computer.  **DO NOT** use
Lacuna in cases where financial or legal harm could come to you as a
result of its malfunction.  (This document is not a legal
document, see [the license](LICENSE.md) for legal terms.)

You should look at the [setup documentation](SETUP.md) if you want to
run Lacuna.
