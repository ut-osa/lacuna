If you have libgcrypt v1.5, you probably need
CONFIG_GCRYPT_REAL_STREAM to be enabled - libgcrypt does the "smart"
thing here and doesn't waste partial blocks.  The kernel, however,
always does.  That is, unless we use my "pad-based" code in the
kernel, which I have not yet put into effect in this version.

Put this in config.mak (CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_GCRYPT_REAL_STREAM).  I
should automate setting this up...

You also should check config.mak to change AES-NI settings.  At the
moment, this is only adjustable at compile time.
